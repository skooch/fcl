WARNING: WE'RE NOT YOUR DAMN LAWYERS. THIS ISN'T LEGAL ADVICE. WE'RE
GIVING YOU THIS CRAP AS-IS, SO DON'T COME CRYING IF SHIT HITS THE FAN.

                        What's This All About?

Most places have stupidly complex laws that automatically give the creator
of stuff exclusive rights to their work. Some folks want to give up those
rights, and have a petty attitude towards the legalese involved in that.

Why? Maybe they want to contribute to some "commons" of creative shit that
anyone can use, change, or sell without worrying about getting sued. Or
maybe they just want to look cool and edgy. Who the fuck knows?

HOLD UP, IMPORTANT SHIT AHEAD: This license is about as legally solid as a
house of cards in a hurricane. It hasn't been tested in any court,
anywhere. If you're dealing with stuff where real legal consequences
matter, don't use this license. Seriously. Go find a boring,
lawyer-approved license instead, like the ones mentioned in the
acknowledgements section. This is for shits and giggles, not for protecting
your ass in court. You've been fucking warned.

                                The Deal

Whoever uses this license (let's call them the "Fucker") is saying:
"I own this shit, but I don't want to anymore. Go nuts with it."
Here's what that means:

1. Copyright and Other Crap

This covers a bunch of legal mumbo-jumbo like:

- Copying, changing, selling, performing, or translating the work
- Moral rights (whatever the fuck those are)
- Image rights
- Unfair competition stuff (with some limits, see section 4)
- Data extraction
- Database rights
- Any other similar bullshit anywhere in the world

2. Giving It All Away

The Fucker is waving goodbye to all those rights mentioned above. They're
throwing them out the window, setting them on fire, and pissing on the
ashes. This applies:

- Everywhere in the world
- For as long as the law allows (including any future extensions)
- For any fucking reason, including making money

3. Backup Plan

If some legal eagle says this waiver doesn't work, here's plan B:
The Fucker gives everyone a free, no-strings-attached license to do
whatever the fuck they want with the work. It's like the waiver, but in
lawyer-speak.

4. Fine Print

- This doesn't mess with trademarks or patents.
- The work is provided as-is. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
- The Fucker isn't responsible for clearing anyone else's rights that
might apply to the work.
- No one else is involved in this clusterfuck.

NOW GO FORTH AND DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT WITH THIS WORK!!!!
